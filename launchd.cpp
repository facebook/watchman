/* When running under launchd, we prefer to obtain our listening
 * socket from it.  We don't strictly need to run this way, but if we didn't,
 * when the user runs `watchman shutdown-server` the launchd job is left in
 * a waiting state and needs to be explicitly triggered to get it working
 * again.
 * By having the socket registered in our job description, launchd knows
 * that we want to be activated in this way and takes care of it for us.
 *
 * This is made more fun because Yosemite introduces launch_activate_socket()
 * as a shortcut for this flow and deprecated pretty much everything else
 * in launch.h.  We use the deprecated functions so that we can run on
 * older releases.
