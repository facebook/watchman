 - Cleaned up Function.prototype.bind with more fixes and tests from
   @bryanforbes.

   `Function.prototype.bind`) internal properties (`bound, boundTo, boundArgs`)
   as in some cases (when using facade objects for example) capabilities of the
   enclosed functions will be leaked.
 - `Object.create` now explicitly sets `__proto__` property to guarantee
   correct behavior of `Object.getPrototypeOf`'s on all objects created using
   `Object.create`.
 - Switched to `===` from `==` where possible as it's slightly faster on older
   browsers that are target of this lib.
 - Added names to all anonymous functions to have a better stack traces.
