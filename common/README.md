This directory mostly contains stub implementations of Facebook libraries that
are not fully open source yet.  These stubs allow the FBOSS code to build while
we are still working on fully open sourcing these libraries.

The code in common/stats is the main piece that is not fully open source yet.
We are working to eventually make all of this code available in the
facebook/folly repository.
